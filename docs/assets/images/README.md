# Sovereign Fleet Assets

This directory contains branding assets for the KI7MT Sovereign AI Fleet documentation.

## Required Assets

### Logo Files

Place your Sovereign Fleet logo files in this directory:

- `sovereign-fleet-logo.png` - Main logo (recommended: 128x128px or larger, transparent background)
- `favicon.ico` - Browser favicon (16x16px, 32x32px multi-resolution)

### Recommended Formats

For best results across all devices and displays:

- **PNG**: Logo with transparency, multiple sizes (128px, 256px, 512px)
- **SVG**: Vector logo for perfect scaling
- **ICO**: Multi-resolution favicon (16x16, 32x32, 48x48)

### Image Guidelines

- Use transparent backgrounds for logos
- Optimize images for web (compress without quality loss)
- Support both light and dark theme variants if possible
- Test logo visibility on both light and dark backgrounds

## Current Status

**Status**: Placeholder files referenced in `mkdocs.yml`

Replace the placeholder references with actual logo files when ready.

## File References

These files are referenced in the main `mkdocs.yml` configuration:

```yaml
theme:
  logo: assets/images/sovereign-fleet-logo.png
  favicon: assets/images/favicon.ico
```

Update the file paths in `mkdocs.yml` if you use different filenames.
